# Parent-of-origin DNA methylation in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris.

This project is a collaboration between the labs of Dr. Eamonn Mallon (University of Leicester, UK), Prof. Tom Wenseleers (KU Leuven, BE) and Dr. Laura Ross (Unviersity of Edinburgh, UK). We aim to identity parent-of-origin DNA methylation in a species of bumblebee with the prediction that it may act as a mechanism of generating parent-of-origin gene expression, i.e. imprinted genes.

## Task 1: Create alternate reference genomes for each parent using SNPs called from WGS
